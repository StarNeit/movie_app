# Movie App

A modern web application for browsing and managing your favorite movies. This project was built using React, TypeScript, and modern web development practices.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable UI components and efficient state management.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, providing better developer experience, code maintainability, and catching potential errors early in development.
- **CSS**: Using modern CSS with CSS variables for theming and maintainable styling architecture.
- **Vite**: Selected as the build tool for its exceptional development experience and fast build times.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

## 📦 Installation

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 💭 Design Decisions & Rationale

### Architecture
- **Component-Based Structure**: The application follows a component-based architecture, separating concerns into reusable components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **TypeScript**: Chosen to enhance code quality and developer experience through static typing, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing runtime errors.
- **CSS Architecture**: Utilizing modern CSS with CSS variables for consistent theming and maintainable styles. The CSS structure follows BEM naming convention for clear and scalable styling.

### State Management
- Using React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect) as the application's complexity doesn't warrant additional state management libraries.
- Props drilling is minimized by thoughtful component composition.

### Performance Considerations
- Vite's development server provides fast hot module replacement (HMR) for quick development iterations.
- Components are structured to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- Images and assets are optimized for production builds.

### User Experience
- Responsive design ensures the application works well on all device sizes.
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual feedback for user actions.
- Error handling with user-friendly error messages.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

1. Implement caching for movie data to reduce API calls
2. Add unit and integration tests
3. Implement progressive image loading
4. Add more advanced search filters
5. Implement user preferences persistence
